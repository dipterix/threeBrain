License to MGH with Right to Sublicense ("Contribution Agreement")
As used in this Contribution Agreement, "you" means the individual contributing the Contribution to FreeSurfer and the institution or entity which employs or is otherwise affiliated with such individual in connection with such Contribution.

This Contribution Agreement applies to all Contributions made to FreeSurfer, including without limitation Contributions made prior to the date of first publication of this Agreement. If at any time you make a Contribution to FreeSurfer, you represent that (i) you are legally authorized and entitled to make such Contribution and to grant all licenses granted in this Contribution Agreement with respect to such Contribution; (ii) if your Contribution includes any patient data, all such data is de-identified in accordance with U.S. confidentiality and security laws and requirements, including but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its regulations, and your disclosure of such data for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement is properly authorized and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; and (iii) you have preserved in the Contribution all applicable attributions, copyright notices and licenses for any third party software or data included in the Contribution.

Except for the licenses granted in this Agreement, you reserve all right, title and interest in your Contribution.
