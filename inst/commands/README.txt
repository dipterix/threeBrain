This is an instruction to open a standalone 3D viewer.

================================ For Windows Users =============================

1. You need **R** to be installed to run the viewer.
   Please download R from the following link if you haven't done so
     https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
   Upon downloaded, install R.

2. If you already have R installed, please double-click [windows.bat].
   It might take a while to open the viewer for the first time, but after that,
   it will be super fast.

================================ For Mac Users =================================

The script [mac.command] could be opened automatically by double-clicking.
If not, please try the following alternatives (either one should work):

1. extract [launch.zip], copy all files extracted to the root folder and
   overwrite existing command files.
   Now you should be able to double-click on [mac.command]

2. Alternatively, right click [mac.command] -> "open".
   A window will prompt confirming that you want to open the file, press "open".

================================ For Linux Users ===============================

Double-click [linux.sh] to open. If the script is not executable, please extract
from [launch.zip] and copy the files, overwrite [linux.sh].
